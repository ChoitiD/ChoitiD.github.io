  <h1 class="title">South Asia in New York</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">New York City is a place that has allowed people to affiliate themselves with their culture, which wouldn’t be possible anywhere else in the country. In order to hitch on to my culture, I have Jackson Heights or specifically Roosevelt Avenue for that. It’s a place where people like me are just going along with life. I can see people walking around either in the typical New York rushed style or in a tired yet optimistic sort of mindset. Middle aged men and women can be seen handling their groceries while trying to work their way through the crowds to get home quickly. Exhausted parents with kids are coming here to get their kids the one candy they wanted but couldn’t find it in their neighborhood. The best group, and the group I associate with myself, are the optimistic teenagers and young adults who come to Jackson Heights for no particular form of work but for the sake of leaving behind their problems. They are the people with smiles across their faces and the people who see Jackson Heights for what it is, no matter what.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">This group of people come here to just catch up with friends or relatives to take in their experience of Roosevelt Avenue. The walk around allows you to experience the fusion of South Asian cultures. When you go down the staircase of Roosevelt Avenue station you are greeted with the fragrance of food coming from the small food carts with a few people gathered around the cart, awaiting the mouth watering meal. The meal may not be the healthiest, but it sure provides the deliciousness to qualify as the contender to make you feel like you are having a feast in South Asia. The smell is irresistible and when you taste it has a spicy yet savory taste to it. That taste stays on your tongue for hours since it contains many spices that bring together a hearty dish. This form of connection has defined how NYC has provided me with that sense of enjoyment with the food of my culture despite being in NYC.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">The clothing stores also have an aspect of my culture in them. The clothing stores have sari’s, salwar kameez, or even panjabis. They are designed with beautiful and elegant gold colored decorations on them to make them good enough to show off to others. It has the same feeling of a garment store in South Asia. I get to embrace my culture through these stores without having to rely on food.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">A special place in Jackson Heights that has been a place of comfort is a small Indian store full of natural products that come from India. The memories of this place root back to my family having small pujas in our home for which my mom made the arrangements needed. I would always be thrilled to go since it meant I get to look at the different statues of Gods and Goddesses and wonder how amazing it was getting this stuff in New York. There were also different beauty products, holy plants, and even the essential items needed for a puja has a special connection specifically to my culture within this city. I never would have thought South Asia was present at a little store in New York City. However besides the Indian store, a place called Sagar Restaurant in Jackson Heights has set another way for me to have connections. We took the chance to dine in or have take-out with respect to my dad for bringing the food in the first place. The food was a fusion of Asian cuisine which meant the restaurant had the divine aroma of the crispy pakoras, the delicate and spicy flavor of fried rice, the ginger infused Thai soup that makes your throat have a slight warm feeling, or even savory and flavorful curry. It provides me comfort to know I have found an aspect of my culture in NYC that wouldn’t be present anywhere else unless I went to South Asia. The restaurants, stores, people, and the environment itself all are present in NYC that doesn’t stray me away from the culture I grew up with. NYC is supposed to be a place where a person can feel comfortable to connect with their culture even if they are not in the place where the culture is. Jackson Heights has provided me with that feeling.</p>
